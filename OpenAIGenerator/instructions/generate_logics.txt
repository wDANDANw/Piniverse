Assume:

// Possible If Predicates:
Compare: This function compares numerical and boolean values. The relationships are established by a set of comparison operators whose elements can be greater, greater or equal, equal, less or equal and less.

Timer: This function handles the system's timing. It determines if a specific time x has expired so that the evaluation of the function is true.

Pointer: This function controls the pointer-events on screen, where x represents the coordinates for those events on the game space.

Keyboard: This function oversees the system's keyboard events, where x is the code for a specific key and label represents the event mode.

Collide: This function watches the collision detection between game actors, where Ag is the actor to report a collision.

// Possible Do Predicates:
Create: It creates a new actor in the game as a copy of an existing actor Ag in the environment.

Read: It allows reading the information of a property that may belong to an actor Ag ∈ AG or to the environment Env of the game.

Update: It modifies the value of a property that can belong to an actor Ag or the environment Env of the game. The new value is determined from the evaluation of an arithmetic expression.

Delete: It removes an actor Ag from the game environment.

// Task
Rewrite the following events to the predicate logic format in the examples.
Format your response similar to the following example:
initialization (ρ1)		{ If(compare(init, TRUE, equal)) → Do(update(velocity, random(−100, 100))) ∧ Do(update(init, FALSE))}
wallXCollision (ρ2)		{ If(collide(wallX)) → Do(update(velocity.x, −1 * velocity.x))}
wallYCollision (ρ3)		{ If(collide(wallY)) → Do(update(velocity.y, −1 * velocity.y))}
wolfCollision (ρ4)		{ If(collide(wolf) → Do(delete(sheep))}
reproduce (ρ5)			{ If(compare(random(0, 100), 2, less)) → If(compare(energy, 50, greaterEqual)) → Do(create(sheep)) ∧ Do(update(energy, energy - 50))}
grassCollision (ρ6)		{ If(collide(grass)) → Do(update(energy, energy + 50))}
