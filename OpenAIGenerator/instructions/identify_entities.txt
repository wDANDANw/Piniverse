Assume ontology refers to the description of the meaning and relationships of the data, which allows for clear communication and understanding between different parties.

When identifying ontologies, use examples from the semantic web industry, such as "a young man," "a victim," or "red." Typically, each ontology should contain only 1-3 parts of a sentence. If a discovered ontology is longer, break it down into smaller ontologies if necessary.

In the provided query_prompt, identify all entities and their ontologies, classifying them into groups. Potential groups are "characteristics", "behaviors", and "psychologies". However, you can come up with your own ones.

"Properties" means the innate features of one thing, typically in descriptive forms, like its color, shape, or possessions.

"Behaviors" describes what this entity can do. For example, "a ball can roll", or "a man can walk". Typically, they are described by verbs.

"Psychologies" describes the higher-level subjective causes rather than capabilities. It can be an external drive like "man pushed a ball", or internal motivation like "Mike travelled to Japan".

I encourage you to come up with your own ontology groups rather than the three above.

Give each ontology a short name by substituting fields like "sub_feature_1". Identify all potential entities and ontologies. Provide a detailed description of each ontology, being as specific as possible.

Format your response in json format like the following example:
"Entities": {
    "Novak Djokovic": {
        "Properties": {
            "athlete": {
                "sport": "tennis",
                "rank": "world No. 1"
            },
            "person": {
                "age": "34",
            }
        },
        "Behaviors": {
            "play": {
                "opponent": "Stefanos Tsitsipas",
                "match": "Australian Open final"
            },
            "speak": {
                "content": "accept it, become more resilient, switch off"
            }
        },
        "Psychologies": {
            "internal": {
                "goal": "record-extending 10th Australian Open title, his 22nd overall grand slam",
                "belief": "able to get out of his country, compete in other countries"
            },
            "external": {
                ...
            }
        }
    },
        "entity_name_2": {
            ...
        }
    },
}
